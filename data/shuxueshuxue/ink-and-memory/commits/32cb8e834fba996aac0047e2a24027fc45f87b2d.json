    "message": "Fix LLM loop bugs: show used personas and clarify phrase length\n\nThe LLM was getting stuck in loops due to two issues:\n\n1. Persona loop: LLM didn't know which personas were already used,\n   so it kept suggesting the same ones (which got filtered silently).\n   Fix: Show explicit \"ALREADY USED PERSONAS\" list in prompt.\n\n2. Sentence occupation confusion: LLM saw short trigger phrases but\n   didn't understand the entire sentence was off-limits, so it tried\n   to comment on different parts of occupied sentences.\n   Fix: Show full sentences with explanation of phrase vs. sentence.\n\n3. Phrase length issue: LLM was returning whole sentences as phrases,\n   making highlights too long and cluttered.\n   Fix: Add explicit guidance for SHORT phrases (2-6 words) with\n   examples and UI context (\"This will be HIGHLIGHTED\").\n\nChanges:\n- backend/stateful_analyzer.py: Add used persona tracking, full\n  sentence display with trigger phrase mapping, phrase-vs-sentence\n  distinction explanation, and SHORT phrase emphasis with examples\n- frontend/src/api/voiceApi.ts: Debug logging (from previous session)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
