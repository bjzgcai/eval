      "reasoning": "The developer demonstrates solid full-stack web development skills with TypeScript/React, showing competent data persistence patterns and UI component work. However, there is minimal evidence of AI/ML expertise, cloud-native practices, or DevOps knowledge. Open source collaboration is moderate with clear commits but limited scope; intelligent development shows reasonable practices with type safety and data normalization; leadership is evidenced by thoughtful architectural decisions like canvas serialization and data structure design, though optimization opportunities remain."
